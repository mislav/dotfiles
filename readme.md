# dotfiles

Mislav's configuration files for bash, zsh, git, ruby, and more.

## Installation

Clone somewhere, then run the `install` script:

~~~ sh
$ git clone git://github.com/mislav/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
$ ~/dotfiles/install
~~~

It won't touch your existing dotfiles, but will symlink the ones that don't
exist. Optionally, move your existing dotfiles to a backup location before
running `install` if you want to completely switch.
